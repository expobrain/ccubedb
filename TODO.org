  - [X] tests

  - [X] destroys should also free things

* DONE cubedb - mappings everywhere

  - [X] simple mapping ds to use for oh so many mappings I have, to be replaced

    The djb2 algorithm (k=33) was first reported by dan bernstein many years ago in comp.lang.c. another
    version of this algorithm (now favored by bernstein) uses xor: hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 33 ^ str[i];
    the magic of number 33 (why it works better than many other constants, prime or not) has never been
    adequately explained.

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
  unsigned long
  hash(unsigned char *str)
  {
  unsigned long hash = 5381;
        int c;

        while (c = *str++)
            hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + c; /* hash * 33 + c */

        return hash;
    }
  #+END_SRC

  - [X] basic server

  - [X] QUIT: disconnect

  - [X] go through the BG's guide with the source code to understand things in the code

  - [X] cmd parsing framework

  - [X] CUBES: dump stupid info on cubes by default

  - [X] CUBE: a certain cube info (partition list)

  - [X] INSERT: insert something into a cube

  - [X] COUNT: count all within a cube

  - [X] COUNTF: count all within a cube with a filter

  - [X] HELP: dump cmd info (this should be defined along with the cmd)

  - [X] PCOUNT per-partition counting

  - [X] PCOUNTF - per-partition counting, filtered

  - [X] DELCUBE cube

* DONE server configuration through args

  - [X] simplistic parse process args (port?)

  - [X] encapsulate configuration somehow

* DONE logging

  - [X] it sould be possible to configure log paths

  - [X] log levels, etc

  - [X] inject

* DONE urgent fixes

  - [X] deleting from the hash table should also reinsert all the following record, up to the next
    NULL

  - [X] better malloc (check the libfirm macros or redis allocation for that) macro that handles
    failed allocations. also need to decide what to do on oom errors in general

  - [X] handle sendall failures (should probably just do REPLY_ERR)

  - [X] when inserting data specifying same keys twice should *not be* possible

  - [X] when filtering data specifying same keys twice should *be* possible

* DONE basic async server
* DONE external tests

  something like a Python-based test client that would run a bunch of commands on a running server

  - [X] base class for a test that runs the subprocess

  - [X] a simple example test

  - [X] test framework

  - [X] cmd_insert

  - [X] cmd_cube

  - [X] cmd_count

  - [X] cmd_countf

  - [X] cmd_pcount

  - [X] cmd_pcountf

  - [X] cmd_help

* DONE the framework

  - [X] extract network stuff into a separate file to avoid server.c cluttering

  - [X] headers in the makefile

  - [X] lower the default log level when running tests in server_test.py. There should be a flag for
    that

  - [X] DELCUBEP cube partition

  - [X] DELCUBEPFT cube from to

  - [X] cmd flags (for cmd with a varying arg num )

  - [X] unify COUNT/COUNTF

  - [X] unify PCOUNT/PCOUNTF

  - [X] unify DELCUBEP/DELCUBEPFT

* DONE when and how filter values should be ORed/ANDed?

  - [X] introduce tests that should fail

  - [X] filter values should be ORed for the same column ANDed for different values

* DONE grouped results

  - [X] result grouping in partition.c

  - [X] pcount_from_to_grouped

  - [X] count_from_to_grouped

  - [X] pcount interface

  - [X] a special value for skipping args ("null?")

  - [X] count interface

  - [X] helper functions for send the data to the client

* DONE argument validation

  - [X] partitions names and cube names should be just graphical symbols
* TODO valgrind

  - [X] fix basic DS memleaks

  - [ ] introduce a set of tests data

  - [ ] a stupid python client loading the data

  - [ ] data sets should touch all commands

  - [ ] run and fix memleaks for all cmds

* TODO client, Python

  - [X] basic client loading data from a file or stdin

  - [ ] client should undestand commands and command return values

* TODO backend DSs

  - [ ] a more generic int hash instead of str by default and use that to fix the reverse mapping
    problem in partition.c:get_column_value_id_value

  - [ ] inserting should not go over everything, a proper position map should do

    currently it's just a list of rows, which is, ehm, wrong

  - [ ] a list of partitions should be sorted, or, even better, should be a autosorted DS

  - [ ] a list of clients should be a mapping

  - [ ] hash table, overwrite an existing value

* TODO input fuzzy tests? test random broken input?
* TODO ubsan, asan
* TODO client, C
* TODO client, (Node) JS

* TODO mmaped DS

  using mmaped DS as a backend would greatly simplify data flushing

  do we want to do this optionally?
* TODO dumping or syncing
* TODO advanced async server

  a framework for those things, with proper extension points
* TODO recursive grouping
